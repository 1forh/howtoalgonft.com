## Finding the NFT you'd like to purchase

Now that your wallet is connected, go to the collection's AB2 Gallery page.

The below example is a collection called <a href='https://ab2.gallery/u/alex' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Alex</a>. Go follow him on <a href='https://twitter.com/Algo_Alex_NFT' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Twitter</a>!

You can find any collection by searching for the collection's Algorand address using the search bar on <a href='' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>AB2 Gallery</a>.

<div className='overflow-hidden text-ellipsis'>
  Another way find a collection if you know the address is by going directly to the page. If the wallet address is `KVC4EZQTW7M3RQWJZZXVDJ7W6THDKK7SEOKAYYSXVBN3U6HD3KKNZ2QL4E` then the AB2 Gallery url for that collection is https://ab2.gallery/address/KVC4EZQTW7M3RQWJZZXVDJ7W6THDKK7SEOKAYYSXVBN3U6HD3KKNZ2QL4E.
