Fill out the form and click confirm.

If the NFT is a 1/1, Quantity and Limit Per Order should be 1. Then you can set the price to however many algos you want.

You can also sell more than copy at a time if your NFT is a fractional NFT. Just update the Quantity and Limit Per Order fields as you see fit.

After clicking confirm, go through the MyAlgo steps. Click confirm again when it comes up. You have to confirm twice to sell the NFT.

Your NFT is now for sale on AB2 Gallery! AB2 Gallery uses smart contracts to send your NFT and a little bit of algos to an escrow account. These are stored there until someone buys the NFT and then all proceeds are sent to you and the NFT is sent to the buyer.
